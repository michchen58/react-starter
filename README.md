### Style Guide
This project is configured use ESLint with [Airbnb's Javascript and React style guides](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). The Webpack bundler will not compile the Javascript unless all the rules pass, so it is strongly suggested you go through the style guide at least once before beginning to code.
